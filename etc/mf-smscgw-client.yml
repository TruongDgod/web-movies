#The pool consists of a fixed number of core threads that are kept inside all the time,
# and some excessive threads that may be spawned and then terminated when they are not needed anymore.
#The corePoolSize parameter is the amount of core threads which will be instantiated and kept in the pool.
# If all core threads are busy and more tasks are submitted, then the pool is allowed to grow up to a maximumPoolSize.
#The keepAliveTime parameter is the interval of time for which the excessive threads
# (i.e. threads that are instantiated in excess of the corePoolSize) are allowed to exist in the idle state.
